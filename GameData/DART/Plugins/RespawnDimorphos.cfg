// How to reset and respawn Dimorphos:
// Simply rename this file from .txt to .cfg
// Then restart KSP and either load your test save or create a new one.
// Every time that you go to the Space Center, Dimorphos will be recreated.
// To stop that from happening, exit KSP and rename this file from .cfg to .txt
